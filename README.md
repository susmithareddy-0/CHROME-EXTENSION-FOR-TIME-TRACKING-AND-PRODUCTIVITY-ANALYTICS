The Chrome Extension for Time Tracking and Productivity Analytics is a browser-based tool designed to help users monitor and analyze their online behavior. It records the time spent on different websites, providing users with a clear picture of their digital habits. This tool is particularly useful for individuals who want to boost their productivity, track work hours, or simply become more mindful of how they use their time online.

The extension offers several core features, including real-time tracking of browser activity, logging of visited websites, and automatic calculation of time spent per site. Users can view this data through a built-in popup or on a web-based dashboard. The extension uses charts and graphs to display daily or weekly summaries, making it easy to spot distractions and focus areas.

This extension is built with modern web technologies. On the front end, it uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js for data visualization. The backend is developed using Node.js and MongoDB, which together handle the collection and storage of tracking data. The extension relies on the Chrome Extensions API to interact with browser tabs and history.

Once installed, the extension runs in the background and listens for tab changes or new page loads. Each time a user visits a new website or switches tabs, the extension logs the URL and timestamp. This data is then sent to the backend, where it is stored and used to generate insightful analytics. The popup UI provides a quick snapshot, while the full dashboard offers deeper insights.

Whether you're a student, freelancer, remote worker, or just someone trying to be more productive, this extension can be a valuable tool. It helps identify time-wasting patterns, encourages mindful browsing, and supports better time management. Developers can also modify or extend the tool for use in teams or integrate it with project management systems.
One of the biggest advantages of this extension is that itâ€™s open-source. Users can clone the project, customize the code, and even host the backend on their own server for full control over their data. Additional features like Pomodoro timers, idle detection, or CSV export can be added based on specific needs. This makes the extension not only powerful out of the box but also highly adaptable for long-term use.
